#  About me
I'm a software developer from Brazil. I'm interested in both low-level
and high-level programming. I'm familiar with technologies like C, Rust, React,
JavaScript, Python, SQL and Shell Script. I'm also a fan of Linux, Vim and
minimalist software.

I'm currently studying cybersecurity, as I really like hacking challenges.
