#  About me
I'm a self-taught programmer based in Brazil. I'm interested in both low-level
and high-level programming. I'm familiar with technologies like C, C++, C#,
JavaScript, Python, SQL and Shell Script. I'm also a fan of Linux, Vim and
minimalist software.

As a programmer I feel our goal should be to make efficient and reliable
software, avoiding bloated code. We should as well be constantly seeking to
improve our skills and learn new tech.

As for my language skills: I can communicate well in English, my native
language is Portuguese and I'm learning Polish, since I have Polish ancestry
and citizenship.
